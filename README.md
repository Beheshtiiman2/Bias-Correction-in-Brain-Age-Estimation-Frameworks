Info:
We present an effective bias-adjustment scheme for neuroimaging-based brain age frameworks. This method removes age-dependency issues caused by regression dilution bias in brain age estimation. The scheme was evaluated in the context of cognitively healthy aging and Alzheimer's disease, showing statistically improved results and making it a crucial component for future brain age frameworks.
